# Open Post: The Open-Source Buffer & Hypefury Alternative

[![Deploy with Clawnify](https://app.clawnify.com/deploy-button.svg)](https://app.clawnify.com/deploy?repo=clawnify/open-post)

A social media post scheduler with a calendar view, multi-channel composer, queue management, and analytics. Built with **Preact + Tailwind CSS + Hono + D1**. Deploys to Cloudflare Workers via [Clawnify](https://clawnify.com).

Think of it as an open-source alternative to **Buffer**, **Hypefury**, **Typefully**, or **Twitter Hunter** -- a complete content scheduling system you can self-host and customize.

## Features

- **Multi-channel composer** -- write once, publish to multiple platforms with per-platform character limits
- **Calendar view** -- month grid showing scheduled posts with platform color dots
- **Queue management** -- chronological list of scheduled posts with one-click publish
- **Drafts** -- save unfinished posts and come back to them later
- **Channel management** -- add your social media accounts with platform detection and color coding
- **Labels** -- categorize posts with colored labels for organization
- **Media attachments** -- add image URLs to posts
- **Analytics** -- bar charts showing posts per channel, per label, and daily activity
- **Dashboard** -- at-a-glance stats, upcoming posts, and recent drafts
- **Twitter/X publishing** -- publish directly to X via Clawnify credential service binding
- **URL routing** -- bookmarkable pages (`/compose`, `/calendar`, `/queue`, `/drafts`, `/channels`, `/analytics`)

### Supported Platforms

| Platform | Character Limit | Publishing |
|----------|----------------|------------|
| X / Twitter | 280 | via Clawnify credentials |
| LinkedIn | 3,000 | coming soon |
| Instagram | 2,200 | coming soon |
| Facebook | 63,206 | coming soon |
| Bluesky | 300 | coming soon |
| Mastodon | 500 | coming soon |
| Threads | 500 | coming soon |
| TikTok | 2,200 | coming soon |

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clawnify/open-post.git
cd open-post
pnpm install
```

Start the dev server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser. The database schema is applied automatically on startup.

### Local Twitter/X Publishing

For local dev, create a `.dev.vars` file with OAuth 1.0a keys from the [X Developer Portal](https://developer.x.com):

```
TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=your-api-key
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=your-api-secret
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-access-token
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your-access-token-secret
```

In production (deployed via Clawnify), credentials are managed automatically through Clawnify's credential service binding -- no API keys needed in the app.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| **Frontend** | Preact, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, Vite |
| **Backend** | Hono (Cloudflare Worker) |
| **Database** | D1 (SQLite at the edge) |
| **Icons** | Lucide |
| **Credentials** | Clawnify credential service binding (Composio OAuth) |

### Prerequisites

    twitter.ts      -- X API v2 client (OAuth 2.0 Bearer + OAuth 1.0a)
    schema.sql      -- Database schema (channels, posts, labels, media)
  client/
    app.tsx              -- Root component with router
    context.tsx          -- Preact context for app state
    hooks/
      use-app.ts         -- State management + CRUD operations
      use-router.ts      -- pushState URL router

      channel-list.tsx   -- Channel management
      analytics-view.tsx -- Bar charts and daily activity
      post-card.tsx      -- Reusable post preview card
      error-banner.tsx   -- Error display
```

### Credential Service Binding

In production, the app uses Cloudflare Service Bindings to fetch fresh OAuth tokens from Clawnify's central credential Worker -- zero network hop, no secrets stored on the app.

```
App Worker --(RPC)--> CredentialService.getToken("twitter", orgId)
  --> Composio (auto-refresh)
  --> Fresh Bearer token
  --> X API v2
```

See [credentials-service-binding.md](https://github.com/clawnify/clawnify/blob/main/docs/credentials-service-binding.md) for the full architecture.
